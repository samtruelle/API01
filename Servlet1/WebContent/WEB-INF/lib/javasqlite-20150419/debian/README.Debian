javasqlite for Debian
---------------------

The Debianization of this package was initially contributed
by Pedro A. Aranda Guti√©rre.

To rebuild from the original tarball use the following commands:

  Normal package with SQLite2 and SQLite3
  $ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us

  Package with SQLite3 SEE (SQLite Encryption Extension)
  the -Isee omits the SEE subdirectory
  $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=see fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -Isee

  Demo package with SQLite3 SEE (SQLite Encryption Extension)
  $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=seedemo fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -Isee

Optionally add the word "noopt" to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
in order to compile without optimization.
